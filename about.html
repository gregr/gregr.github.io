          Notable personal projects

        <p>
          The following projects were the product of significant effort made as I grew up as a programmer.
        </p>
        <p>
          Being possibly overcritical about my own past work, I'm not particularly proud of any of these.  But even with such reservations, I feel it's still important to share.

            <p>
              This was my first serious attempt at a full programming language implementation.  It includes a scheme-like hygienic macro system based on syntactic closures.
            </p>
            <p>
              It was put aside when I started working at Facebook.
